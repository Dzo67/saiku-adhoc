###If you want to install Saiku-Reporting in your Bi-Server 3.10-stable

- Extract the zip-file into pentaho-solutions/system

- Install CDA (if you havent yet).

ATTENTION: Lately there has been some confusion with the libraries responsible for CDA-Access. 
For now we can only make sure that Saiku Reporting works in Pentaho Bi-Server 3.10 if you use the
CDA-Extension that we provide with the plugin (pentaho-reporting-engine-classic-extensions-cda-experimental.jar).
If you have no pentaho-reporting-engine-classic-extensions-cda-xxx.jar in your pentaho/web-inf/lib directory
you will not be able to export a PRPT-Report to your solution repository.
Same applies if you have the "wrong" version of that extension installed. To be sure that the export
works, you should delete the pentaho-reporting-engine-classic-extensions-cda-xxx.jar in pentaho/web-inf/lib 
with the one that we provide. 

If you're testing a snapshot of a Bi-Server > 3.10 you will have to checkout build the cda-extension yourself.

###If you want to build Saiku-Reporting:

First build the UI project from git@github.com:Mgiepz/saiku-adhoc-ui.git by checking it out and running:
mvn clean package  install:install-file -Dfile=target/saiku-adhoc-ui-2.2-SNAPSHOT.war  -DgroupId=org.saiku -DartifactId=saiku-adhoc-ui -Dversion=2.2-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=war

Then checkout https://github.com/Mgiepz/saiku-adhoc.git, cd into saiku-adhoc-core and run:
mvn clean install

Then if all went well cd into saiku-adhoc-plugin and run:
mvn clean package

In the resulting "target" directory you will find a saiku-adhoc-plugin-2.2-SNAPSHOT.zip file.
